# Blackjack-Simulator
Hello there! As a part of my journey in learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I've created this tiny project - a simulation of the classic card game, Blackjack (also known as 21). It's a simple yet fun way to apply what I've been learning in web development.  The objective of the game is straightforward: to achieve a sum total of 21 with your cards.
